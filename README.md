# Libraries

Library archives will be created in the `bin/release` directory.

Note: make sure to use `[plugin_name].debug.a` when exporting with `Export With Debug` checkbox checked and use `[plugin_name].release.a` otherwise.  Linker errors may occur if the wrong file is used.

# Troubleshooting

If you add third-party dependencies to your Podfile and encounter the following error:

```
[!] CDN: trunk URL couldn't be downloaded: https://[dependency-url].podspec.json Response: Failure when receiving data from the peer
```

Running the build script with the -p option may solve the issue by removing pod repository trunk before building plugin.

`./script/build.sh -cpb`

or

`./script/build.sh -cpgA4.2`
